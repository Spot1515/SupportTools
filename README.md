# SupportTools
This program has a set of tools for my Daily Support Job

This is a work in process i will be adding items as i find way to work smarter and not harder in my daily job

1. Create a daily notes do each day
  This is a doc i used to keep track if the Ticket i have worked on and any notes i am taking on them.

2. Creates a daily Temp Folder
    This is a folder that put all of my random  daily files.
    Ether report and things form customers or scripts im working with

3. for each new ticket added into the doc a matching Temp folder wil be created
    it also check if there is any matching ticket folder in any other daily temp folder.
    If so it copys them into todays folder.

4. Daily Temp Folder Archive
    It will auto zip any daily temp folder before a given date
    and move them into an archive folder
